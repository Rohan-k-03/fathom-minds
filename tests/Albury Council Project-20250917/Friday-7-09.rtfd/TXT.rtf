\f0\fs26\fsmilli13333 Just a quick note regarding the data we\'92re working with, while the data does not contain any sensitive or private information, it is still the property of AlburyCity. Under the La Trobe and AlburyCity Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), specifically section 5.4, we are covered in terms of data use. However, to err on the side of caution, please let the students know this data is not to be shared outside of this project and once project is complete, they should delete the data.
